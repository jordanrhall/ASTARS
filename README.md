# ASTARS

Derivative-Free Optimization (DFO) algorithm for noisy convex functions which leverages [active subspaces](https://github.com/paulcon/active_subspaces) for efficiency

Please see our corresponding [paper and technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07444) on arXiv

## Installation instructions:

* If you do not a computational environment set up to run Python, download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
* Clone this repo locally, using `git clone git@github.com:jordanrhall/ASTARS.git` in a destiniation of your choosing (in terminal)
* In the ASTARS directory you've just created, run `python setup.py install` (in terminal)

Now you should be able to run any of our examples (stored in paper_examples). 
e.g., navigate to paper_examples in terminal and run `python paper_examples.py` (in terminal)

Enjoy!
